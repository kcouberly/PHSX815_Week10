## averages_distribution.py

Plots a distribution of the averages of an non uniform probability distribution

Use inputs -Nexp and -Nsample to change the number of experiments and number of samples

Default Nsample = 10 Nexp = 500

## Results

Plots resemble a gaussian, although there is some variation with the sample sizes used

As Nsample increases, the gaussian peak increases, the exponential term of the gaussian appears to depend on Nsample
